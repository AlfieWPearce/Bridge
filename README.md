# Bridge
Coding Languages: HTML / JS (Node / Express / Ngrok / P5) | Category: Game | Difficulty: 3

Bridge is a full-stack web application built for my A-Level Computer Science NEA. It's designed around the idea of "connecting" users, data, and processes through a structured, secure backend and a clean, responsive frontend interface.

**Due to the strict exam regulations:**
- The source code will be uploaded in August, once the exam board allows it.
Until then, this rep serves as a project overview

**-- Feautures --**

- Node.js backend with modular routing
- Lightweight Express Server
- Local development tunnelled using Ngrok
- Interactive frontend with dynamic behaviour
- Designed with security and clarity in mind
- Written with an eye toward maintainability

**--**

**-- How to play (after August) --**

1. Clone the project:
`bash
git clone https://github.com/AlfieWPearce/Bridge
`
2. Install dependencies locally:
`bash
npm install
`
3. Start the server
`bash
npm start
`
4. Open a web tunnel (localhost works, but this will allow usage on any device)
`bash
npx ngrok http 3000
`
5. Use the forwarded Ngrok URL to interact with the app.
